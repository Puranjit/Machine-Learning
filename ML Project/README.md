 <b>This folder contains a Data Science project with implementations of various ML algorithms on the dataset that was prepared after performing data exploratory analysis/ data wrangling on the data
</b> 
 The follwoing steps were completed in the project -
 1. Reading data into DataFrames (Library used - Pandas)
 2. Data wrangling - Removing noise, filling/removing null values, statistical analysis using various visualizations (Libraries used - Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
 3. Implement ML algorithms on the dataset to understand and develop a model that could learn on using independent features and predict dependent variables robustly (Libraries used - Scikit-learn, XgBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas)
 4. Results/ conclusions presented at last
