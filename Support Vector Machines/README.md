# Support Vector Machines
<b> Support vector machines performs classification, regression and outlier detection tasks. It does this by drawing hyperplane (a straight line) to seperate the classes. The data points that are located on one side of the line will be labelled as Group A, whilst the points on other side will be labelled as group B</b>

This folder includes files that explains the practical implementation of Support Vector Machines (SVM)
