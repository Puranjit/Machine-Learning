# Decision Trees
It is a probability tree like structure model that continously splits data to categorize or make predictions based on the previous set of questions that were answered. The model learns features of the data and answers questions to help you make better decisions

# Random Forest
Similar to decision trees, random forest is also a tree-based algorithm. Where decision tree consists of one tree, Random forest uses multiple decision trees for making decisions - a forest of trees. It combines multiple models to make predictions and can be used in Classification and Regression tasks

This folder includes code that explains practical implementation of Decision trees and Random forests
