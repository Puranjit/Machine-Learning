# Prinicpal Component Ananlysis (PCA)
### Dimensionality reduction
<b> Dimensionality reduction is used to reduce the number of input variables in the training data, by reducing the dimension of your feature set. When a model has higher number of features, it is naturally more complex and leading to higher chance of overfitting and decrease in accuracy.</b>

The Prinicpal Component Ananlysis (PCA) technique is a type of Dimensionality Reduction.
