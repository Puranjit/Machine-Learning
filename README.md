# Machine-Learning
## This repository focuses on giving an introduction and practical implementation of various 
1. Machine Learning Algorithms using Scikit-learn 
2. Developing Deep learning models using Tensorflow and Scikit-learn
3. ML Project - project that I developed from scratch (Data exploratory analysis, Data wrangling, Implementing ML algorithms (Regression models), Discussions, Results, Conclusions)
